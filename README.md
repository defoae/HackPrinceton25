## What is AI Slop?

> AI slop is digital content made with generative artificial intelligence, specifically when perceived to show a lack of effort, quality or deeper meaning, and an overwhelming volume of production. Coined in the 2020s, the term has a pejorative connotation similar to spam.
> 
> AI slop has been variously defined as "digital clutter", "filler content prioritizing speed and quantity over substance and quality", and "shoddy or unwanted AI content in social media, art, books and search results".
>
> Jonathan Gilmore, a philosophy professor at the City University of New York, describes the material as having an "incredibly banal, realistic style" which is easy for the viewer to process.
